       Infrastructureless Rack based session storage
        "All we need is your file-system wingman!"
           "Hiiiigh waaaay to the DANGER ZONE!"


A very alpha implementation of file based session persistence for Rack
applications.

The specs were ported from the Rack memcached session store.
